            <emph>Third in a series</emph>
         </p>
         <p>
            What is it like to be a Negro<lb/>
            student on a white campus? Each<lb/>
            Negro student has his own <choice><orig>per-<lb/>
            sonal</orig><reg>personal</reg></choice><lb/> opinion.<lb/></p>

            <p>"There’s no difference,“ main<lb/>
            tained one sophomore, “Negro is<lb/>
            just a legal term the white man<lb/>
            made up for convenience."<lb/> </p>

            <p>“No, our culture is different,"<lb/>
            projected a dark-skinned boy.<lb/>
            "It’s composed of James Brown<lb/>
            and the Supremes."<lb/></p>

            <p>"They stare at me in class when<lb/>
            we discuss slavery or Africa,"<lb/>
            noted one young girl. “I guess<lb/>
            it’s out of curiosity."<lb/></p>

            <p>"People yell out of car windows<lb/>
            at me," put in an adamant coed,<lb/>
            cursing the University under her<lb/>
            breath. This was Doris, a <choice><orig>dis-<lb/>
            satisfied</orig><reg>dissatisfied</reg></choice><lb/> Negro, bitter towards<lb/>
            her four years at the University.<lb/>
            Doris sells Black power <choice><orig>but-<lb/>
            tons</orig><reg>buttons</reg></choice><lb/>, “a quarter for Negroes, a<lb/>
            dollar for whites."<lb/></p>

            <p>"You can’t write an article on<lb/>
            Negroes," she told this reporter.<lb/>
            "Anything you write, white people<lb/>
            will think is interesting... but to<lb/>
            colored people it won’t mean a<lb/>
            thing."<lb/></p>

            <p>Only colored people know and<lb/>
            understand colored people, she<lb/>
            maintains. This seems to be<lb/>
            true, for the white student cannot<lb/>
            find a typical Negro student from<lb/>
            which to generalize about the<lb/>
            200-400 colored undergraduates<lb/>
            on campus.<lb/></p>

            <p>The Negroes compose a <choice><orig>hete-<lb/>
            rogeneous</orig><reg>heterogenous</reg></choice><lb/>population, demarcat-<lb/>
            ed from the rest of the student<lb/>
            body by skin color and/or a few<lb/>
            tables in the Main Dining Hall<lb/>
            or the Student Union. The Negro<lb/>
            students’ views are varied, their<lb/>
            experiences largely dissimilar,<lb/>
            and even their skin tones are of<lb/>
            different shades.<lb/></p>

            <p>This is an article about the<lb/>
            Negro students in the Union. They<lb/>
            comprise an amorphous group of<lb/>
            between 40-50 students who <choice><orig>gath-<lb/>
            er</orig><reg>gather</reg></choice>in the cafeteria every after<lb/>
            noon to eat, “shoot the breeze”<lb/>
            and play pinochle.<lb/></p>

            <p>Who are they? How do they<lb/>
            mingle with white students? These<lb/>
            are glimpses of the experiences<lb/>
            they relate as they sip Cokes<lb/>
            and munch on pizza between<lb/>
            classes.<lb/></p>

            <p>Social events is a major topic<lb/>
            these students discuss when<lb/>
            viewing their interaction with<lb/>
            whites.<lb/></p>

            <p>“At dorm deserts, I don’t really<lb/>
            fit in,” said Gary, a cool College<lb/>
            Joe who talks fast and smiles a<lb/>
            lot. “They don’t play our kind of<lb/>
            music.”<lb/></p>

            <p>“At one desert,” he continued<lb/>
            wryly, “I asked a white girl to<lb/>
            dance. She refused me, so I sat<lb/>
            down.”<lb/></p>

            <p>Later, he noticed the girl danc-<lb/>
            ing with white boys. He went over<lb/>
            to her and asked her for the next<lb/>
            record."<lb/></p>

            <p>“Her girl friends were pushing<lb/>
            her to dance with me,” he re-<lb/>
            called. “So she did. We danced,<lb/>
            and in the middle of the record<lb/>
            she burst into tears and ran to<lb/>
            her housemother.”<lb/></p>

            <p>Deducing a moral from his<lb/>
            story, Gary declared, “I don't<lb/>
            care if they don’t want to dance<lb/>
            with me, I just wish that before<lb/>
            each desert they’d make a list of<lb/>
            girls who won’t dance with me so<lb/>
            I'll know."<lb/></p>

            <p>On the whole, Gary encounters<lb/>
            little "open" prejudice in his<lb/>
            dormitory. However, Donna, a<lb/>
            calm, attractive Negro student,<lb/>
            prefers to live at home and com-<lb/>
            mute rather than to room in a<lb/>
            dormitory.<lb/></p>

            <p>At summer orientation last<lb/>
            July, she explained, she was the<lb/>
            only Negro in her tour group.<lb/>
            "They were surprised, I guess,<lb/>
            to see a Negro. They said<lb/>
            nothing against me, but they<lb/>
            stared as if they didn’t expect<lb/></p>

            </div>
            <pb></pb>
          <div>
            <head>
              <title>Negroes note white preconceptions</title>
            </head>
          </div>

          <div>

            <p>to see a Negro in their group."<lb/></p>

            <p>“I used to live in Philadelphia,"<lb/>
            Donna continued. "I was in the<lb/>
            minority... so I got used to the<lb/>
            feeling of being the only one there<lb/>
            and people staring."<lb/></p>

            <p>But this feeling is "kind of<lb/>
            lonely," and that was why Donna<lb/>
            “declined living on campus--be<lb/>
            cause of summer orientation."<lb/></p>

            <p>"I haven’t had any problems<lb/>
            with any students in class," she<lb/>
            continued. “They even come to<lb/>
            me and ask me for help. They<lb/>
            don’t judge you by your color, but<lb/>
            by what you can do." But Donna<lb/>
            still prefers to live at home,<lb/>
            rather than on campus.<lb/></p>

            <p>Another commuter, Alphonso,<lb/>
            was part of a nucleus of Negro<lb/>
            students who tried to establish<lb/>
            a “bi-racial" fraternity on cam-<lb/>
            pus last spring. Plans were made<lb/>
            to establish Omega Psi Phi, but<lb/>
            due to a start late in the semes-<lb/>
            ter, the group was unable to<lb/>
            start a chapter.<lb/></p>

          </div>
        <div>
        <p>
          <emph>Meeting ‘awkward’</emph>
        </p>

            <p>“Many people who wanted to<lb/>
            become charter members com-<lb/>
            muted from Baltimore," Alphonso<lb/>
            explained. It was “awkward for<lb/>
            them to come back for a meeting<lb/>
            at night." Also, a set sum of<lb/>
            money had to be laid down within<lb/>
            a one-week time limit. Gary<lb/>
            feels that this payment deadline<lb/>
            prevented the group from gen-<lb/>
            erating more immediate interest.<lb/> </p>

            <p>Dwayne, a commuter who<lb/>
            spends part of each afternoon in<lb/>
            the Union improving his game of<lb/>
            pinochle, explained why he would<lb/>
            like to establish a fraternity.<lb/></p>

            <p>“Everybody likes to have some-<lb/>
            thing when they graduate, a group<lb/>
            to call back together, a group to<lb/>
            talk up old times. It’s good to<lb/>
            be able to come back and look<lb/>
            at the work you have done."<lb/></p>

            <p>He and Alphonso also note<lb/>
            that a fraternity would give the<lb/>
            Negro students a chance to par-<lb/>
            ticipate in Homecoming, to com-<lb/>
            pete in athletic events, and to<lb/>
            gain a voice in campus affairs.<lb/></p>

            <p>Other Negroes disagree. They<lb/>
            see little unity in a “bi-racial"<lb/>
            fraternity, they anticipate that<lb/>
            Negroes would remain together,<lb/>
            and this would not alter signifi-<lb/>
            cantly their present rate of in-<lb/>
            teraction with whites.<lb/></p>

            <p>Another student added that<lb/>
            although Negroes have been<lb/>
            “shunner" from “going into fra-<lb/>
            ternities, “I would not join a<lb/>
            fraternity simply (only) because<lb/>
            it was black."<lb/></p>

            <p>None of the 24 social frater<lb/>
            nities on campus are racially<lb/>
            integrated with whites and Ne-<lb/>
            groes. The fraternities have<lb/>
            no discriminatory clauses in<lb/>
            their charters, but attitudinal<lb/>
            barriers and apprehensive feel-<lb/>
            ings seem to bar a Negro from<lb/>
            pledging a white house.<lb/></p>

            <p>These feelings are not fostered<lb/>
            by white students alone. Negroes<lb/>
            find they are reluctant to rush<lb/>
            a white fraternity. They doubt<lb/>
            that they would be pledged, and<lb/>
            if they were, they wonder if they<lb/>
            could be accepted as a brother.<lb/></p>

            <p>Also, at parties, could the Ne-<lb/>
            groes bring white dates without<lb/>
            offending or shocking the alumni<lb/>
            and brothers?<lb/></p>

            <emph>Interdating</emph>
          </p>

            <p>These Negroes do interdate.<lb/>
            They state that white girls are<lb/>
            generally more friendly toward<lb/>
            their race than white boys.<lb/></p>

            <p>White people, they note, seem<lb/>
            very concerned with pressures<lb/>
            exerted by their friends. Negro<lb/>
            boys dating white coeds have been<lb/>
            told that when their dates return<lb/>
            to the dormitory, every one in<lb/>
            the hall flocks around them to<lb/>
            ask questions.<lb/></p>

            <p>If a Negro mixes socially with<lb/>
            whites, however, peer-group re-<lb/>
            action is minimal. Explained<lb/>
            Gary, “If you’re in the group,<lb/>
            you’re in... We don’t care...<lb/>
            You do what you want to do."<lb/></p>

            <p>White girls, they note, expect<lb/>
            Negro boys to be fast on a date.<lb/>
            They are surprised when they<lb/>
            find Negro behavior to the con-<lb/>
            trary. According to several<lb/>
            Negro boys, colored girls are<lb/>
            “a lot more shy than white girls."<lb/></p>

            <p>“They don’t do things in pub<lb/>
            lic," explained one boy. “On the<lb/>
            Mall, I’ve seen things Negro girls<lb/>
            won’t do."<lb/></p>

            <emph>Sorority obstacle</emph>
          </p>

            <p>One thing Negro girls can’t do,<lb/>
            it seems, is join a sorority.<lb/>
            Last year, two Negro girls went<lb/>
            through fall sorority rush. One<lb/>
            girl received no invitations to<lb/>
            the second round of parties, but<lb/>
            the other girl was invited back<lb/>
            to several houses. However,<lb/>
            after this second group of par<lb/>
            ties, that girl was dropped too.<lb/></p>

            <p>This year another girl, Sharon,<lb/>
            signed up for rush. Cute, petite<lb/>
            and well-dressed, Sharon said<lb/>
            she went through rush because<lb/>
            she had taken it for granted that<lb/>
            “you go to college, and you join<lb/>
            a sorority."<lb/></p>

            <p>“I was disappointed not to see<lb/>
            some Negroes in the sororities,"<lb/>
            she said. “Out of 18 sororities,<lb/>
            you would expect to see one. I<lb/>
            was shocked. Especially on a<lb/>
            campus this size. Rush was sup<lb/>
            posed to be so open and all."<lb/></p>

            <p>During rush, she reports,<lb/>
            “everybody was nice." After open<lb/>
            house she was invited back to ten<lb/>
            houses. But for “set of four"<lb/>
            parties, she received no return<lb/>
            bids.<lb/></p>

            <p>Negroes may join the service<lb/>
            fraternity and sorority on cam-<lb/>
            pus. Of the students interviewed,<lb/>
            one was a member of Gamma Sig-<lb/>
            ma Sigma sorority. Others were<lb/>
            members of the marching band,<lb/>
            P.E Majors Club, the football<lb/>
            team, and the chess club.<lb/></p>

            <p>A perusal through Terrapin<lb/>
            yearbooks shows that other<lb/>
            colored students are in Univer-<lb/>
            sity Theater productions, publi-<lb/>
            cations staffs, ROTC groups, the<lb/>
            Nursing Club, the M Club and the<lb/>
            Pharmacy Club.<lb/></p>

            <p>But even in these groups, there<lb/>
            are only one or two Negro mem-<lb/>
            bers. The low proportion of<lb/>
            Negro students on campus is not<lb/>
            the lone factor preventing large<lb/>
            Negro participation in campus<lb/>
            activities.<lb/></p>

            <p>The Negroes in the union<lb/>
            "group" feel that a veil of ap-<lb/>
            prehension limits Negro-white<lb/>
            interaction outside of class. This<lb/>
            cloak of apprehension is the last<lb/>
            barrier for a Negro student to<lb/>
            overcome before he will vie for<lb/>
            acceptance in an all-white group.<lb/>
            This cloak of apprehension is<lb/>
            the last barrier that a white<lb/>
            person must overcome before he<lb/>
            will forget color, disregard nega-<lb/>
            tive peer-group reactions and<lb/>
            boldly sit down at a Negro table<lb/>
            in the Union.<lb/></p>

            <p>Part of Friday’s installment<lb/>
            was incorrectly organized to<lb/>
            due a mechanical mistake.<lb/>
            The Diamondback regrets the<lb/>
            error.<lb/></p>
